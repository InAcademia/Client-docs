# Client (RP) examples

This section contains client (RP) configuration examples for implementing InAcademia in some commonly available software libraries

Note: the following code samples are not secure enough to be used in a live production environment, they are only intended to document the basic steps required to complete a transaction with the InAcademia service. Additional measures should be implemented to increase the security.

* Apache mod OIDC (platform independent) -> https://github.com/InAcademia/Client-docs/blob/master/Apache2%2Bmod_auth_oidc
* pyOIDC (Python) -> https://github.com/InAcademia/Client-docs/blob/master/pyoidc
